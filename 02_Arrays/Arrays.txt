Arrays:

1. Calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
2. Find largest number in the array.
3. Find second larget number in the array.
4. Calculate the frequency of each element in the array.
5. Count the number of pairs in the array whose sum are equal to 30.
6. Merge two arrays. Given arrays A and B merge it to new array C and print C.
7. Find if the array A is subset of array B.
eg: A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {1, 2, 4, 5, 3} -> yes A is Subset of B
	A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {4, 5, 5, 1, 2, 3} ->  A is subset of B
	A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {1, 2} -> A is not subset of B
8. Find all prime numbers from given array.
9. Reverse the element of array.
10. Create subset from the array. (extract unique element from the array)
eg: A = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 2} -> {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
11. Check if array contains unique elements.
